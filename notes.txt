Ultrasonic sensor:
- measures in cm
- would need offset to prevent alerts going off every time
- would need to account for people "walking"

Arduino connections: 
- https requests to servers dont work too well on Arduino;
    - possible reasons:
        - SSL certificate is required which is embedded in Arduino UNO R4, however unrealistic for ESP32-WROOM modules
        - possible that Arduino boards have a specific limit on requests to discord webhook
